   * from.  It supports command line processing, and logging facilities. Derived classes will need to override 
   * the virtual methods "ApplicationName", "DisplayCommandLineParameters", and "ProcessCmdLineParameter".  Right
   * after an instance is created you need to call the "InitalizeApplication" method; this will start the processing
   * of any encountered parameters. For each set of parameters encountered a call to "ProcessCmdLineParameter"
   * will be made; this is where you can intercept and process parameters that are specific to your application.
   * Any parameters that you do not recognized should be passed onto the base-class by calling 
   * "Application::ProcessCmdLineParameter".
